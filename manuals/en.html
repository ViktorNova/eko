<h3>Why "EKO"?</h3>

<p>There are two reasons behind this. The first one is that "eko" is sounds just like "echo", thus related to the sound domain. And another reason is an idea of animal rights promotion. I don't know how exactly EKO can help with that, but is is obviously for me that the freedom of software or music just a one step to the more global freedom, the freedom of the personality - and not just a human personality, but also of all animals. From the my point of view there is no difference of the life value between the human or a small mouse. They are equal.</p>


<a name="mni_start"></a>
<h3>Basics</h3>

<p>EKO is a very simple sound editor. Unlike some other editors, it has no disk caching system, so all files will be loaded directly into the memory. It means that EKO needs a lot of memory if you work with a large files or with many files simultaneously.</p>

<p>EKO internals is 32 bit floating point mixing and DSP engine. All recording and playback uses Portaudio library to access the underlying sound system (ALSA, ASIO, etc.). Before using EKO, set up input and output devices/ports at <b>Tune - Sound devices</b> page. If recording or playback does not work, try another option.
</p>




<br>
<a name="mni_go"></a>
<h3>Playback and looping</h3>

<p>EKO is different. EKO doesn't have tons of options of playback. When you press the magic key Space, EKO starts to play the current file. If you press the Space again, EKO pauses, not stops. To stop, you can press the Stop button on the toolbar. The "Stop" stops the sound and moves the cursor to the beginning of the file.</p>

<p>There also a "Looped" checkbox at the toolbar. When it is checked, EKO plays the current selection (if some area is selected) or the while file. That's how it works.</p>

<br>
<a name="mni_recording"></a>
<h3>Recording</h3>

<p>To record a sound file, use <b>File - Record</b>, Press "Stop" button when done. To set up sound format, go to the <b>Tune - Common</b> page, and there press "Set default format for new files" button. Due to some Portaudio features, EKO opens the input sound device in stereo mode, but then, if mono recording is selected, downmix or takes just one channel, left or right. Customize this on <b>Tune - Sound devices</b>.
</p>

<p>When recording, EKO uses temporary file at the temporary directory, system's by default. You can redefine EKO temp directory at <b>Tune - Common</b>. So the maximum length of the recording depends on the free space of the disk partition where your temporary directory is located.</p>

<br>
<a name="mni_fxrack"></a>
<h3>FX rack</h3>

<p>As you can see, EKO has the rack for realtime effects. There you can add or delete some effects. They can be tweaked in realtime and it will sounds. When you'll decide to apply them "offline" to the selected area or the whole file, press the "Apply" button at the bottom of FX Rack. Also you can rearrange effects via "up" and "down".</p>

<p>Currently there are no so much built-in realtime effects. The external plugins will be supported in the future. Probably maybe.</p>


<br>
<a name="mni_interface"></a>
<h3>Interface</h3>

<p>From the top to bottom, there are:</p>

<p>1. <b>The main menu</b>. Note that you can tear submenus off and place them somewhere over the desktop. Menu items are depended on the current task or even editor mode. Some menus can be visible or hidden according to the task (editing, file browsing, etc.).</p>

<p>2. <b>The toolbars area</b>. Actually, toolbars can be parked at the any side of EKO window. Positions are saved between sessions. To turn the toolbar on and off, use the context menu for the toolbar (right click on the toolbar). If no toolbar is visible, do the right click on the menu bar.</p>

<p>3. <b>The tabbed area</b>. It contains four main tabs - <b>edit</b>, <b>manage</b>, <b>tune</b> and <b>learn</b>. <b>Edit</b> - that where you see opened documents. <b>Manage</b> - a built-in file manager. <b>Tune</b> - here you can change EKO preferences. All changes will be applied immediately. <b>Learn</b> - the built-in User manual. This, this one.</p>

<p>4. <b>Logmemo</b>. It is a notification area. Destination: all warnings, information messages, etc.</p>

<p>5. <b>The Famous input field</b> (FIF). An input text field that is used for Find (read about a <b>Search</b> menu for details). FIF has three buttons - <b>Find</b>, <b>Find previous</b> and <b>Find next</b>. FIF is used also for a search in the EKO manual, menu items list (at the hotkeys customization page) and even the built-in file manager.</p>

<p>6. <b>The status bar</b>.</p>

<br>
<a name="mni_manager"></a>
<h3>File manager</h3>

<p>The EKO's file manager is hidden under the <b>manage</b> tab. It is not an additional bloatware tool, but the essential part of the editor. It replaces the standard File save/open dialogs (by the way, you can bring them back using <b>Tune &gt; Interface &gt; Use traditional File Save/Open dialogs</b> option).</p>

<p>Let's see on the shining force of EKO's file manager.</p>

<p>At the top the directory bar is located. There are an entry with the current directory path, and a nice toolbar with following weird-looking buttons:</p>

<p><b>Go</b> - navigates to the directory with the path from the text entry.</p>

<p><b>Home</b> - teleports you to your cozy home directory.</p>

<p><b>Refresh</b> - refreshes a files list to your pleasure.</p>

<p><b>File operations</b> button with submenu. It contains some utility actions such as <b>Create new directory</b>, <b>Rename</b> and <b>Delete file</b>. Please note that EKO does not delete the directories.</p>

<p>The <b>right panel</b> of the file manager.</p>

<p>At the top you see the file name field. Here you can name a file to open or save it. To save the current file under some name, just put the filename into the <b>Name</b> text entry and press the <b>Save as</b> button. To open a file,  double click on the file name at the files list, or put the file name into the <b>Name</b> entry and press the <b>Open</b> button. You can use the Enter key inside of this input field. The action is related to the menu item  (File open or Save as) that you used to open the file manager tab.<p>

<p>You can also select multiply files (Ctrl-click) and then press the <b>Open</b> button.</p>

<p><b>Bookmarks</b> list. You can easily add and remove the directory bookmarks using the "+" and "-" buttons. The "+" button adds a bookmark to the file system tree's current directory. The "-"  button removes the selected bookmark. To activate the bookmark and navigate to the according directory, double click on the bookmark.</p>


<br>
<a name="mni_file"></a>
<h3>File</h3>

<p><b>New</b>. This menu item creates an empty file with parameters those defined under  <b>Tune - Common - Set default format for new files</b>. Actually EKO holds internally all sound data at 32-bit floating point sample values, and external conversion to other formats happens on saving or loading.</p>

<p><b>Open</b> - if you are using the build-in file manager, read the <a href="#mni_manager">File manager</a> chapter. Otherwise, use the standard "File open" dialog window.</p>

<p>EKO supports many sound formats using the libsndfile library: WAV, AIFF, AU, RAW, PAF, SVX, NIST, VOC, IRCAM, W64, MAT4, MAT5, PVF, XI,           HTK, SDS, AVR, SD2, FLAC, CAF, WVE, OGG and others. WAV PCM is supported from signed 8 bit up to up to 64 bit double, with any sample rate.</p>

<p><b>Save</b> - if your file is already saved, this menu item saves it again. That is how it works. But, if a file is not saved, you shall see a surprise! A <a href="#mni_manager">File manager</a>. There, put the file name into to the <b>Name</b> entry and press the <b>Save as</b> button.</p>

<p>To save a file in a different format and file name use <b>File - Change format</b> window, choose some format, then do <b>Save As</b>. To save a file under the same filename with the different format, use <b>File - Change format</b>, and then <b>Save</b>. In this case, if the file extension is not the extension of the selected format, the proper extension will be given to the resulting file name.</p>

<p>Some examples:</p>

<p>Let's assume that you have WAV at 16 bit PCM, test.wav. If you select the AIFF format at then <b>Save</b>, you'll get the "test.aiff" file.</p>

<p>If you have a new file and try to save it without the file extension, EKO add the file extension according the file format.</p>

<p><b>Last closed file</b> - opens a last closed file. This sentence is a greater paradox of XXI century CE.</p>

<p><b>Save as different &gt; Save timestamped version</b> - saves a content of the current document with name, where the timestamp is added. So you shall know the date and time related to the saved version. Note about timestamp format. Is is yyyy-MM-dd-hh-mm-ss. So the first comes a year, then a month, then days, hours, minutes and seconds.</p>

<p><b>Recent files</b>. From this submenu you can open one of the last dozen opened files.</p>

<p><b>Sessions</b> - at this menu sessions are available. The session is a simple list of opened files. To load them all, just choose a session name from this menu. To save a session use <b>File  &gt;  Save different  &gt;  Save session</b>. At the preferences <b>Common</b> page you can check the <b>Restore the last session on start-up</b> option. If this option is turned on, EKO will save the session on exit (under the name <i>def-session-777</i>), and then load this session when starting.</p>

<p><b>File actions</b> submenu. <b>Reload</b> is a function to reload the current file's content from the disk.</p>


<p><b>Exit</b> - closes EKO. To reduce the annoyance, EKO doesn't ask to confirm it.</p>


<br><br>
<a name="mni_edit"></a>
<h3>Edit</h3>

<p><b>Cut, Copy, Paste</b> - works similar as in any other sound editor. When you paste sound data into the other file, the data from clipboard will be resampled to the destination file sample rate and channels count will be reduced or expanded according to the destination file channels count.</p>

<p>To select data, you can use: the mouse, or Shift-left/right keys, or "[" and "]" keys to set the range. To deselect, just click somewhere out of the selection.</p>

<p><b>Copy to new</b>  - copy the selected data to the new file. The new file will have sound format as the source data.</p>

<p><b>Copy to new (default format)</b>  - copy the selected data to the new file. The new file will have sound format as the default sound format for a new file (you can set it at the <b>Tune - Common</b>).</p>


<br><br>
<a name="mni_search"></a>
<h3>Search</h3>

<p>EKO has no dialog windows for the search. EKO uses the Famous input field (FIF) and menu-driven interface. FIF works in Keyboard setup and the manual panel. Type + enter = search, F3 - search next from the cursor position.</p>

<br>
<a name="mni_functions"></a>
<h3>Functions</h3>

<p>This menu holds "offline"-processing functions such as reverse, fade, RMS calculation, channel management and others.</p>

<p><b>DC offset</b> - this menu contains functions to fix the DC offset. In most cases you can use <b>Fix DC offset auto</b> and you can do it multiply times on the same portion of data to get the correct DC. Another way is to use two functions - <b>Detect DC offset</b> first, then copy offset value from Logmemo, then use <b>Fix DC offset manually</b> and enter that offset value into the input entry. The best result for <b>Detect DC offset</b> is calculate when you scan the shifted "silence" (which looks like a completely solid waveform).</p>

<br>
<a name="mni_nav"></a>
<h3>Nav</h3>


<br>
<a name="mni_fm"></a>
<h3>Fm</h3>

<p><b>Fm</b> is meaning the <b>File manager</b>. This menu contain functions those related to EKO file manager and visible when the <b>browse</b> tab is active.</p>

<p><b>Fm &gt; Select by regexp/Deselect by regexp</b> - use this functions to select or deselect files by regexp pattern. For example, to select all txt-files at the current dir, put the following regexps into the FIF:"<i>.*\.txt$</i>" (without quotes!)
then, use <b>Select by regexp</b>. Then you can press Open button to open all selected files.</p>


<br>
<a name="mni_view"></a>
<h3>View</h3>


<p><b>Themes</b> - EKO has some built-in GUI themes.</p>


<p><b>Palettes</b> - from this submenu you can select the color scheme that affects the wave editing area.</p>

<p><b>Profiles</b> - this menu allows you to switch between view profiles (they includes parameters such as window position, size, etc.). So you can save your current settings via <b>Save profile</b> function, and named profile will appear at the <b>Profiles</b> menu. In any time you can select it to recall saved settings.</p>


<br>
<a name="mni_prefs"></a>
<h3>Preferences</h3>

<p>On <b>Keyboard</b> tab you can assign the shortcuts with the menu items. To set a new hotkey, select a menu item from the list, then press some hotkey combination at the entry to the right from the list, and press the <b>Assign</b> button. To remove a hotkey, select the menu item from the list and press <b>Remove</b> button. To re-assign the hotkey that already in use, do <b>Remove</b> for this shortcut first.</p>
